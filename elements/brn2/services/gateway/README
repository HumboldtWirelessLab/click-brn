Gateway
- uses the DHT to save the a list of known gateways (especially it stores this nodes internet connectivity (this mesh node's gateway metric))
- decides, when to write or read values from DHT

GatewaySelector / reader of known gateways
- calls method trigger on Gateway to get the list of available gateways (read-only???) and computes the best known gateway and tags the packet appropriate
- reacts if used gateway seems to be broken (tells this the gateway, which temporary removes the entry, but does not write it to DHT)

ICMPPingSourceGatewayTester / writer of this node's gateway metric to known gateways
- calls method set_gateway_metric on Gateway element to update metric
- writes only significant changes
