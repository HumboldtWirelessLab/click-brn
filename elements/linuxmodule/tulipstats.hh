 * =c
 * TulipStats(DEVNAME)
 * =s profiling
 * reports statistics gathered from Tulip device
 *
 * =d
 *
 * TulipStats gathers statistics from the Tulip network device named DEVNAME
 * and reports them via the C<counts> handler. It schedules itself on the task
 * queue; use ScheduleInfo to set its scheduling tickets (it doesn't need very
 * many). Each time it is scheduled, TulipStats will poll the Tulip's receive,
 * transmit, and error states. It will be called whenever there is an
 * interrupt, and maintains counts of how many interrupts happened and why. It
 * also maintains detailed counts of missed frame count errors, FIFO
 * overflows, and many other kinds of errors. Some of these values are already
 * maintained by the device driver, but their values can be unreliable under
 * heavy load unless TulipStats is used.
 *
 * =e
 *
 * Here is a sample use of TulipStats:
 *
 *    ts :: TulipStats(eth0);
 *    ScheduleInfo(ts 0.01);
 *
 * =h counts read-only
 *
 * Returns all statistics kept by TulipStats, one per line. Each line has a
 * human-readable description and a number.
 *
 * =h reset_counts write-only
 *
 * Reset all counts to zero.
 *
 * =n
 *
 * The C<counts> handler returns a lot of information. Here is a sample dump:
 *
 *   PC (polling stats count):               15031503

 *
 * C<PC (polling stats count)> is the number of times the Tulip was polled.
 * C<IC (intr count)> is the number of interrupts it generated, more or less.
 * (The device driver can sometimes count more interrupts than actually
 * occurred.)
 *
 * Every time the Tulip is polled, TulipStats takes note of its error state,
 * transmit state, and receive state. C<EB0> through C<EB7> are error state
 * counts, C<TS0> through C<TS7> transmit state counts, and C<RS0> through
 * C<RS7> receive state counts. The sum of the eight values C<EB0> through
 * C<EB7> will equal C<PC>, and similary for C<TSx> and C<RSx>.
 *
 * The group of stats starting with C<TI (transmit intr)> and ending with
 * C<NIS (normal intr summary)> correspond to the reasons the Tulip gave for
 * interrupting.
 *
 * The rest of the stats, starting with C<OCO (overflow ctr overflow)>, report
 * the values for counters on the Tulip, such as missed frame counters.
 * TulipStats reports the accumulated difference in these counters since it
 * was installed. Thus, C<MFC> does not report the total number of missed
 * frames since last boot, but only the number of missed frames since
 * TulipStats was installed, or since the last C<reset_counts>.
